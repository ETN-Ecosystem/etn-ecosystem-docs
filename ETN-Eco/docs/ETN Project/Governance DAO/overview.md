# ⚖️ Governance and DAO Overview

The ETN Ecosystem is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) 🤝, allowing community members to participate in key decisions. The DAO operates through a Governance Council, where members use their Governance NFTs to vote on proposals, shaping the future of the ecosystem.

## 🌐 Key Features

- **Decentralized Governance:** Decisions are made collectively by the community.
- **Transparency:** All proposals and votes are recorded on the blockchain.
- **Empowerment:** Every holder of a Governance NFT has a voice in the council.

Join the ETN Governance DAO and help build a truly community-driven ecosystem. 🏛️
