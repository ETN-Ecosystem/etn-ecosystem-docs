The word "Netsa" (ነፃ) originates from Amharic, the national language of Ethiopia. It translates to "freedom" or "liberation." The essence of "Netsa" captures the spirit of cryptocurrency, particularly those based on the TON blockchain, which is founded on principles of decentralization and financial freedom.

### Etymology

- **Amharic Script**: ነፃ 
- **Meaning**: Free, Freedom or liberation

By naming our coin "Netsa," we emphasize our commitment to the ideals of autonomy and empowerment inherent in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.
